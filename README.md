Now that AI handles the syntax, a programmer's real job is articulating intent - translating an idea for an app into plain language for the model to execute. Instead of pounding that out on a keyboard, why not just talk to your computer? This repository is a Dockerized training pipeline for custom audio trigger models (compatible with OpenAI Whisper and [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper)). Define vocal shortcuts, wake words, or navigational phrases like "Hey Dummy", "Ok Computer", "Hey Jarvis", then use them with [Atlas Voice](https://github.com/briankelley/atlas-voice) or your own client-side app.

# OpenWakeWord Custom Wake Word Training (Dockerized)

### The Dependency Problem

This project exists because training OpenWakeWord models in 2026 is a dependency nightmare. The training pipeline requires PyTorch 1.13.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and dozens of other packages pinned to 2022-era versions that have since aged out of compatibility with modern Python. The `train-wakeword.sh` script will build a complete dockerized training solution. The `train.sh` script does the exact same thing, but installs native dependencies with no docker requirement. Both scripts freezes the working environment of openWakeWord to commit 368c037 (main on February 1, 2026).

### Objective

Builds a Docker container, downloads training data, generates synthetic speech samples, augments them with common noise, trains a neural network, and outputs a model file (~200KB) that can listen for your wake word.

### Requirements

- **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support
- **Docker** with [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html)
- **~45GB free disk space** (20GB training data + container workspace)

All packages and dependencies are handled inside the container.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/briankelley/atlas-voice-training.git
cd atlas-voice-training
./train-wakeword.sh
```

Launch the main script and it'll walk you through the process:

1. **Builds the Docker image** (first run only, cached after that)
2. **Asks if you want to proceed** with the ~20GB training data download
3. **Asks for your wake word** with advice on what works best
4. **Shows default training settings** (configurable)
5. **Launches training** inside the container
6. **Models saved** to `docker-output/`

### Output

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  Training Complete!
  Wake word: "Hey Atlas"

  Models:
    hey_atlas.onnx    (201K)
    hey_atlas.tflite  (207K)

  Accuracy:  81.07%  (how well it tells your wake word apart from everything else)
  Recall:    62.20%  (how often it catches your wake word; higher = less repeating yourself)
  FP/hr:     1.24    (phantom activations per hour when you're not speaking the wake word)

  Output directory: /output/
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

### Using the Model

Copy the `.tflite` file to `~/.local/share/openwakeword/` for use with OpenWakeWord.

The trained model handles wake word detection only. To build a full voice input pipeline, you also need:

| Package                                                     | Purpose                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [OpenWakeWord](https://github.com/briankelley/openWakeWord) | Loads the `.tflite` model and listens for the wake word   |
| [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) | Speech-to-text transcription after the wake word triggers |
| [sounddevice](https://python-sounddevice.readthedocs.io/)   | Audio capture from your microphone                        |

### Wake Word Selection

**Use a two-word phrase.** This was a big factor in model quality across every configuration I tested. A prefix like "Hey" or "Okay" gives the model a stronger acoustic signature.

| Wake Word                    | Accuracy   | Recall     | FP/hr    | Verdict                         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| "Hey Atlas" (50k samples)    | **81.10%** | **62.48%** | 2.12     | Best overall                    |
| "Globe Master" (50k samples) | 81.07%     | 62.20%     | **1.24** | Two-word phrase, consistent     |
| "Hey Atlas" (100k samples)   | 77.47%     | 55.08%     | 0.62     | More conservative, worse recall |
| "Atlas" (50k, 3 aug rounds)  | 71.64%     | 43.54%     | 2.57     | Single word, consistently worse |
| "Atlas" (50k, 64 neurons)    | 71.94%     | 44.04%     | 2.48     | Extra neurons didn't help       |

No combination of augmentation rounds, sample count, or neuron depth made the model more accurate when the "Hey" prefix was dropped.

### Training Settings

The defaults produce the best balance of accuracy and recall based on empirical testing. You can change this before training. Hat tip to [@dscripka](https://github.com/dscripka) for great defaults.

| Setting             | Default | Purpose                                           | Testing Notes                                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Samples             | 50,000  | Number of synthetic speech clips generated        | Doubling to 100k didn't improve accuracy or recall |
| Augmentation rounds | 2       | Times each clip is re-processed with noise/reverb | 3 rounds produced no measurable improvement        |
| Training steps      | 100,000 | Neural network training iterations                | 150k steps didn't improve results                  |
| Layer size          | 32      | Neurons per hidden layer                          | 64 neurons produced identical results to 32        |

### Training Data

Training data is hosted on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/brianckelley/atlas-voice-training-data) and downloaded automatically in standalone mode (~20GB as a single tarball).

| File                       | Size   | Purpose                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ACAV100M features          | 17 GB  | 2,000 hours of pre-computed negative examples       |
| MUSAN music                | 4.6 GB | Background audio for augmentation                   |
| MIT Room Impulse Responses | 300 MB | Room reverb simulation (pre-converted to 16kHz)     |
| Validation features        | 177 MB | False positive testing during training              |
| Piper TTS model            | 200 MB | Synthetic speech generation                         |
| Embedding models           | ~10 MB | OpenWakeWord melspectrogram and embedding inference |

All training data is bundled in a single ~20GB tarball and downloaded automatically.

### How It Works

Training runs in three phases inside the container (start to finish with defaults and broadband is ~1h on a 4090):

1. **Generate clips** - Piper TTS creates thousands of synthetic pronunciations of your wake word with varying voices, speeds, and pitch
2. **Augment clips** - Each clip is layered with room reverb, background noise, and acoustic conditions (runs on CPU)
3. **Train model** - A neural network learns to distinguish your wake word from everything else (runs on GPU)

The output is an ONNX model and a TFLite model, both under 250KB.

### Files

| File                      | Purpose                                                                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train-wakeword.sh`       | What you run - interactive host wrapper (run this on your rig)         |
| `train.sh`                | Bare-metal path - installs and runs everything natively without Docker |
| `container-entrypoint.sh` | Runs inside the Docker container                                       |
| `Dockerfile.training`     | Builds the training environment                                        |
| `validate_model.py`       | Compare model accuracy against test data                               |

### Issues encountered and fixed (all from the upstream dependency stack):

1. `torch==1.13.1` - no wheels for Python 3.12+
2. `pyarrow` - broke `datasets` API (pinned `<15.0.0`)
3. `fsspec` - broke `datasets` glob patterns (pinned `<2024.1.0`)
4. `webrtcvad` - needs C compilation, undocumented dependency on `build-essential`
5. `python3.10-venv` - version-specific package naming
6. HuggingFace download leaves `.cache` directories that break training
7. MIT RIR files nested in `16khz/` subdirectory
8. MIT RIR files are 32kHz, training expects 16kHz
9. Docker shared memory - PyTorch DataLoader needs `--shm-size=32g`
10. HuggingFace rate limiting from repeated individual file downloads
11. Training segfaults on cleanup after model is already saved (harmless)
12. Python output buffering in Docker hides progress (`PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`)
